# Implementing a Multilayer Perceptron From Scratch to Classify Handwritten Images

## Python 3 Libraries and Modules Used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Competencies Demonstrated:
- Basic machine learning knowledge (i.e. database organization/formatting, algorithm usage)
- Intermediate machine learning knowledge (i.e. algorithm theory and processes demonstrated via the from-scratch MLP implementation)
- Advanced Python knowledge (i.e. data types and interchanges, for, if-else statements, function creation, class creation)

## Purpose and Usage:

- Purpose - demonstrate how Artificial Neural Network Classification Models can be used for image recognition via a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). In this case, the MLP is used to identify the true class labels (number 0-9) of handwritten digits.

- Usage - this code uses the database of handwritten digits originally from the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) which was accessed and downloaded via Kaggle
